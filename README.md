# Python Workshop

A repository for a basic pre-OOP Python programming workshop that I do for my clubs: Human Computer Interaction and Applied Data Analytics at De Anza College.

## Purpose

Kickstart any Python-related programming project by learning the fundamentals of programming and Python syntax. After this workshop, you'll be able to read and understand Python code, and with some practice and additional learning, you can start writing your own. This includes projects like our handwritten digits classification or any other Python application. Use AI wisely as a learning tool.

## Why Python?

Python's simple, readable syntax makes it perfect for beginners, while its power and flexibility make it ideal for professionals. It's the go-to language for AI and Machine Learning, and it's widely used across web development, data science, automation, and more. You can build almost anything with Python (except web frontends). Here are some popular libraries:

- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)
- Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Science & Scientific Computing)
- OpenCV, Pillow (Computer Vision & Image Processing)
- FastAPI, Flask, Django (Backend Web Development)
- Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium (Web Scraping & Automation)
- Discord.py, Tweepy (Bots & API Integration)
- Tkinter, PyQt, Streamlit (GUI & Data Visualization Apps)

## Ready?

If you don't have an editor and Python installed, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for now to test the code along with the workshop. However, I would highly recommend setting up your coding environment (editor and Python interpreter).

## Workshop Overview

This 1-hour workshop covers the essential Python basics:

1. **01.py** - Introduction: Comments, Print, F-strings
2. **02.py** - Variables and Data Types (int, float, str, bool)
3. **03.py** - Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)
4. **04.py** - Operators & Control Flow (Arithmetic, Comparison with if-else, Logical operators)
5. **05.py** - Loops (for, while, iterating through data structures)
6. **06.py** - Functions (defining, parameters, return values)

Each lesson is designed to be concise and hands-on, perfect for learning by doing!

## Practice Ideas

After completing the workshop, try building these mini-projects to reinforce what you learned:

- **Temperature Converter**: Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- **Grade Calculator**: Input scores and calculate letter grades
- **Shopping List Manager**: Add, remove, and display items with prices
- **Number Guessing Game**: Computer picks a random number, you guess it
- **Word Counter**: Count how many times each word appears in a sentence
- **Simple Calculator**: Perform basic math operations based on user input
- **FizzBuzz**: Print numbers 1-100, but "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for 5, "FizzBuzz" for both
