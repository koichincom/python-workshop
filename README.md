# Python Workshop - Programming Basics

This repository is for a workshop to cover the basics of pre-OOP Python programming to help beginners get started with projects in our clubs: Human Computer Interaction and Applied Data Analytics.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop covers essential Python concepts needed as a foundation before learning OOP:

1. **Introduction & Setup** - Getting started with Python
2. **Variables & Data Types** - Understanding Python's basic data types
3. **Operators** - Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations
4. **Control Flow** - if/else statements and conditional logic
5. **Loops** - for and while loops, iteration patterns
6. **Functions** - Creating reusable code blocks
7. **Data Structures** - Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
8. **Modules & Imports** - Code organization and using libraries

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or similar)
- Basic computer literacy

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Verify Python installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   # or
   python3 --version
   ```
3. Navigate to the workshop directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-workshop
   ```

## Workshop Structure

```

├── lessons/          # Lesson files with explanations and examples
├── exercises/        # Practice exercises for each topic
├── solutions/        # Solutions to exercises
└── README.md         # This file
```

## How to Use This Workshop

1. Start with lesson 01 in the `lessons/` directory
2. Read through the lesson file and run the code examples
3. Complete the corresponding exercises in `exercises/`
4. Check your solutions against `solutions/` after attempting the exercises
5. Move to the next lesson once you're comfortable with the material

## Running Python Files

To run any Python file:

```bash
python filename.py
# or
python3 filename.py
```

## Tips for Learning

- Type out all code examples yourself instead of copy-pasting
- Experiment by modifying the examples
- Complete all exercises before checking solutions
- Don't rush - understanding is more important than speed
- Use the Python interactive shell to test small code snippets

## Getting Help

## Next Steps

After completing this workshop, you'll be ready to learn:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Advanced data structures
- File handling and I/O
- Error handling and exceptions
- Working with external libraries
